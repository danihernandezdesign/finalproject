My face, as visualized by this project.

#### Background:
In a recent study, children who reported frequent experiences with discrimination were at higher risk of depression, anxiety, oppositional behavior and other mental health problems — but only among the children with less developed ethnic-racial identities. Children who are raised with a strong sense of their ethnic-racial identity are more resilient to the psychological harm that such discrimination inflicts. Ethnic racial identity often forms through social interactions, which poses added challenges for those children who are multiracial. They simultaneously belong to more than one racial group but often feel that they don’t ‘fit in’ with any group of people. Many white parents feel unprepared to speak with their children about their racial identity, and conversations with their children are often reactive when emotions are high as opposed to proactive and laying a foundation for understanding that gets built over time. The problem for white parents is that they are less likely to instill a positive understanding of racial identities in their multiracial children because they don’t feel like they understand race themselves. 

I’m interested in how understanding racial identity can begin at home. Based on current assumptions and feedback from potential participants, most parents don’t have a lot of time on their hands. However, many felt that they were willing to put in more effort if the benefits to their child seemed clear.  My thesis project will focus on creating co-learning opportunities for white parents of multiracial children to increase their children’s understanding of their racial identity. The current plan for my intervention is a roughly six-week facilitated documentary creation workshop and online community nicknamed “Identity Explorers”. It will begin with an in-person co-creating session with participants to establish shared goals and commitment to the project and what they will each be getting out of it. The next several weeks will be ran over social media, with prompts, challenges, and ‘badges’ to be earned through a micro-video each week. I’ll be checking in via phone with participants each week to gauge how each week went and what went well or needs adjusted for the next week. At the end, parents’ micro-videos will add up to one large video for their children. There will be a final in-person meeting with participants for final feedback and the online community will live on as a lasting resource for participants.

#### Purpose: 
This final project seemed like a really interesting way to visualize and humanize the information that users would be submitting. The idea of using a face also ties in well with the visual language I’ve already established for my thesis. This project hinged on answering the question: how can I foster community by visualizing shared experiences in the parents who will be participating in my project?
#### Process:
###### Step 1: Collecting + Analyzing data
What questions might serve as a baseline for establishing understanding and a quick overview of parents' and childrens' current understanding of ethnic racial identity? The questions posed in my visualization were based on insights from my thesis research and topics that keep coming up. Instead of identifying an existing dataset, I was committed to designing an interactive experience where the dataset would be built and visualized in realtime. I’ve always loved Giorgia Lupi's "Data Portrait at Ted" that utilizes personal data to create a connection between people. Is there a way to streamline and scale it to showcase what makes us similar and also what makes us unique? 

###### Step 2: Process

I built an .eps of a face that is modified through buttons and prompts that are fully editable. At the check-in with Joey, I had several questions. 

###### Step 3: Final Visualization
I was able to change the fills of the paths of my .eps as patterns - allowing me to build in additional meaning to the visualization through symbolism. The key is below:

As you can see, through certain colors that denote positive vs. negative (within my thesis' project brand palette) and symbols for 'yes' and 'no', participants responses' were visualized on the vector face.

#### Ongoing Challenges + Next Steps:
Participants can generate an image and reset it - but I struggled to encode a way to make it save. I experimented with the 'save button' exporting the canvas to JSON - however in attempting to shift my code back into a sketch.js file the entire thing broke. Prior to Joey's advice, I installed a couple .js files I thought might help according to help boards and people posing similar questions to no avail. The current band-aid solution is having participants take screenshots and upload to the website - however there is always an option to share that image via the online community I'll be building at the start of my intervention. 

I wanted to be able to generate a living database where images would be saved and immediatly uploaded into a viewable repository on the site. As I couldn't get the save function to work - this fell by the wayside. However, as long as participants send their images my way I'm able to manually upload and display them. Which, honestly, may be a better solution anyway to ensure security and to build communication with participants as soon as possible.
